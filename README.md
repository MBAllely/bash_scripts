## RAINBOW TERMINAL **YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH**

OK Real instructions.

1. Put this stuff in the appropriate files at the top level of your machine 
` cd ~ ` gets you there, if you're unfamiliar.
2. Check to see if these files exist first.
`ls -a` will five you a thorogh list of what you've got.  

3. To edit the contents, run either

` atom FILENAME` or

`nano FILEMNAME` or, if you're a fan of Vim, 

`vm FILENAME`  Personally, I think vim is gross.  But, preferences!

4. If these files don't exist yet, make 'em!  You can use the same commands as above to do that.

5. Bippity bobbity RAINBOW TERMINAL YEAAAAHHH
