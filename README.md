### WOW IT'S SO GREAT

OK Real instructions.

1. Put this stuff in the appropriate files at the top level of your machine 
` cd ~ ` gets you there, if you're unfamiliar.
2. Check to see if these files exist first.
`ls -a` will five you a thorough list of what you've got.  

3. To edit the contents, run either ` atom FILENAME` or `nano FILENAME` or, if you're a fan of vim, `vim FILENAME`  Personally, I think vim is gross.  But, preferences!  Do what makes you happy, yo.

4. If these files don't exist yet, make 'em!  You can use the same commands as above to do that.
ex: `atom .bash_profile`, then dump the contents of this repo's `.bash_profile` right on in there, etc etc. 

5. Bibbity bobbity RAINBOW TERMINAL YEAAAAHHH
