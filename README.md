### WOW IT'S SO GREAT

#### Prerequisites

Uh, just **Git**, I think.  Also this is for **bash**.  Sorry, Powershell.

## OK Real instructions.

1. Put this stuff in the appropriate files at the top level of your machine. That's it.  

## **OK REAL-ER INSTRUCTIONS**

1.  Go to the top level of your machine. If you're unfamiliar, open up your terminal and type `cd ~ `.
2. Check to see if these files exist first.  `ls -a` will give you a thorough list of what you've got.  
3. To edit the contents of the existing files, run either ` atom FILENAME` or `nano FILENAME` or, if you're a fan of vim, `vim FILENAME`  (Personally, I think vim is gross.  But, preferences!  Do what makes you happy, yo.)  Then add the contents from this repo into your corresponding files.  Easy peasy!
4. _If these files don't exist yet_, make 'em!  You can use the same commands as above to do that.
ex: `atom .bash_profile`, then dump the contents of this repo's `.bash_profile` right on in there and save, etc etc. 

5. Bibbity bobbity RAINBOW TERMINAL YEAAAAHHH

6. (optional) customize your terminal theme to complement your SICK NEW SETTINGS (and guarantee readbility).  I chose the theme 'pro' and set it to default.

## BUGS

It'll open every new tabs at `~/` which is slightly annoying but completely workable.  If you figure out how to fix it, pls let me know how you did it.
